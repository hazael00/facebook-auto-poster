# facebook-auto-poster
A simple facebook auto-poster application made by c# (also my first project)

## HOW TO USE ?
1.Login to your Facebook account using the text boxes on the left. <br/>
2.Fill all the text boxes than click to `start posting`.

**NOT! if you got any issue about elements try to change time intervals.** <br/>
**NOT! if application doesn't pop up remove the `chromedriver.exe` than reopen the application.**
